#Collectivist

Collectivist is the successor to [CDJ Messenger](https://github.com/viruzx/cdj-messenger) which was crippled by it's own excessive and redundant security measures and proceedures.

Collectivist attempts to give another go at the idea of a distraction-free forum/messenger app but with a better design, cleaner code and supperior performance. As opposed to CDJ, Collectivist not longer relies on Orchestrate.io but instead stores all the data it using in `.json` files.

#Why would I want to use Collectivist?

I developed Collectivist as a way for my friends and I to organise easier. The reality is that no other app thought of sticking a live chat and real-time forum side-by-side on a single page. I find this layout extremely comfortable: no need to private message every single person to do a survey or asking it on a group chat while half of your collegues miss it, just make a thread for it. No need to ask a short question on a forum, you got a live chat on the side.

See? Very comfortable.

##What it shouldn't be used for

 - Groups with large amounts of people: like any group chat, after a certain point, there are too many messages.
 - Anything you would use Slack for, it is simply not the same and cannot furfill that purpose.
